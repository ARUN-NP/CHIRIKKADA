# [CHIRIKKADAAA!!] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [404NOTFOUND]


### Team Members

### Project Description
[A wildly unconventional way to control your computer mouse using just your nose ‚Äî because why use your hands when your face can do the job? Move your cursor by wiggling your nose, smile to click, and flash your right hand palm for right-clicks. Who needs a mouse when you‚Äôve got this?]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Why bother with actual mice or touchpads when noses and silly hand gestures exist? Traditional mouse control is just too boring, and sometimes your hands get tired from all that scrolling and clicking. Plus, have you ever tried to control a cursor with your nose? Neither have we, until now!]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We harnessed the magical powers of Mediapipe and Python to transform your nose into a super precise cursor controller. Want to click? Smile! Need a right click? Show your palm! Want to drag stuff around? Just raise your index finger. It‚Äôs quirky, weird, and absolutely useless ‚Äî but hey, it works!]

*We controll the cursor throughout using our nose, clicking is done by smiling. iniytially we drag a folder and place it somewhere else in the desktop itself, the click and hold is done using the index finger. then we head to a browser using our nose, perform a google search and select and image. we right click on the image using right-hand open palm and save it to our desktop. we close the browser again with our nose.  *
