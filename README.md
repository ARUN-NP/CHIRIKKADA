# [CHIRIKKADAAA!!] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [404NOTFOUND]


### Team Members
- Member 1: [Arun NP] - [Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science]

### Project Description
[A wildly unconventional way to control your computer mouse using just your nose ‚Äî because why use your hands when your face can do the job? Move your cursor by wiggling your nose, smile to click, and flash your right hand palm for right-clicks. Who needs a mouse when you‚Äôve got this?]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Why bother with actual mice or touchpads when noses and silly hand gestures exist? Traditional mouse control is just too boring, and sometimes your hands get tired from all that scrolling and clicking. Plus, have you ever tried to control a cursor with your nose? Neither have we, until now!]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We harnessed the magical powers of Mediapipe and Python to transform your nose into a super precise cursor controller. Want to click? Smile! Need a right click? Show your palm! Want to drag stuff around? Just raise your index finger. It‚Äôs quirky, weird, and absolutely useless ‚Äî but hey, it works!]

*We open a browser using only nose control, search for an image on Google, and select it by smiling.*

*We right-click on the image using a right-hand open-palm gesture and save it to the desktop. Finally, we close the browser using nose control.*


### Project Demo

*We control the cursor entirely using our nose. Clicking is performed by smiling.
Initially, we drag a folder and place it somewhere else on the desktop ‚Äî the ‚Äúclick and hold‚Äù action is done using the index finger.
Next, we navigate to a browser using our nose, perform a Google search, and select an image. We right-click on the image using an open-palm gesture with the right hand, then save it to our desktop. Finally, we close the browser again using only nose control. *


## Team Contributions
